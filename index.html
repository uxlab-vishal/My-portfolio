  <section id="about" class="about container">
    <p class="about-intro">
      I’ve been designing since my teenage years—by 16 I was at Yandex launching products for
      millions. I deliver elegant solutions that combine visual refinement with simple core concepts.

    <p class="about-hobby">
      In my free time I enjoy 3D and graphics (commission for Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch)
      and run an office bar where our team unwinds.
